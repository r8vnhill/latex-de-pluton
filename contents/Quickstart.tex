\section { Quickstart }
  For the ones that want to just use this template and don't care about the details, this is the 
  section you'd want to focus on.

  \subsection { Using the template with Overleaf }
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Step 1:} \textit{Download the repository} as a zip file. 
        Alternatively, you can clone the repository and zip it manually.
      \item \textbf{Step 2:} \textit{In Overleaf, create a new project} and \textit{import} the zip 
        file.
        \texttt{New Project > Upload project}.
      \item \textbf{Step 3:} In the \textit{Project Menu} go to \texttt{Settings > Compiler} and 
        select \texttt{XeLaTeX}.
    \end{itemize}
  
  \subsection{ Using the template locally }
    Coming soon.

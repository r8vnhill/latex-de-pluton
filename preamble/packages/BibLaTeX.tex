% | BibLaTeX - Sophisticated Bibliographies in LaTeX
% | 
% | The BibLaTeX package is used for advanced bibliography handling in LaTeX. 
% | This package is a powerful and flexible tool to manage and format bibliographic data. 
% | It supersedes the traditional BibTeX program and provides additional features such as 
% | multiple bibliographies and per-entry options.
% | 
% | The specific command \usepackage[backend=biber, sorting=ynt]{biblatex} imports BibLaTeX
% | with two options:
% | 
% | 1) The backend is set to 'biber', a modern program for processing BibLaTeX's 
% | bibliographic data. Biber offers full Unicode support and greater flexibility in data 
% | manipulation than the traditional 'bibtex' backend.
% | 
% | 2) The sorting is set to 'ynt', which stands for 'year, name, title'. This means that 
% | the entries in the bibliography are sorted first by year (in descending order), then by 
% | author/editor name, and then by title. This is one of several possible sorting schemes 
% | available in BibLaTeX.
% | 
% | Parameters:
% | backend=biber - Sets the backend program to process bibliographic data.
% | sorting=ynt - Defines the sorting scheme for the bibliography.

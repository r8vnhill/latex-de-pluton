% | varioref, hyperref, cleveref - Enhanced cross-referencing in LaTeX
% |
% | These three packages are used together to provide enhanced cross-referencing capabilities in LaTeX.
% | The 'hyperref' package is used to handle links within the document. 
% | The 'varioref' package provides commands for flexible cross-references.
% | The 'cleveref' package enhances LaTeX's cross-referencing features, allowing the format of references 
% | to be determined automatically according to the type of reference.
% |
% | When used together, they should be loaded in the order: hyperref, varioref, cleveref. 
% | This is because 'hyperref' redefines many LaTeX commands and should be loaded last to avoid conflicts. 
% | However, 'cleveref' has to be loaded after 'hyperref' as it further modifies some of 'hyperref's commands. 
% | 'varioref' should be loaded before both to avoid any compatibility issues.
% |
% | Importantly, these packages when used together, enhance LaTeX's default referencing system, 
% | allowing for the creation of hyperlinks, flexible referencing and intelligent reference format detection.
% |
% | Parameters: 
% | None, these packages are imported without options in this example. 
% | However, options may be specified depending on the requirements.
% |
% | Note: 
% | Pay attention to the order of importing these packages, the recommended order is: varioref, hyperref, cleveref.

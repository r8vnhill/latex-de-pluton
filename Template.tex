  \section{Introduction (or Why I Created this Template)}
    This template was born because there's one big problem with \LaTeX: it's very difficult to start
    learning it.
    But the thing is, it's not because \LaTeX\ is overcomplicated, it's because there's little to no
    material to learn.

    This is an ambitious task, because I want you to be able to use this template as-is with minimal
    \LaTeX\ knowledge, but also give you the tools to learn it and to understand how this template is
    made.
    It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or an advanced \LaTeX\ user, this template is aimed at 
    everyone.
